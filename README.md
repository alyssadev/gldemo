I took pygame's [glcube](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/blob/master/examples/glcube.py) and hacked on it a bit.

Controls

Left/right: rotate cube in direction
Up/down: increase/decrease x axis rotation
W/S: increase/decrease FOV (zoom cube in/out): resets rotation
R: reset all rotation to beginning parameters
O: toggle outlines on cube(s)
A: toggle second cube
E/D: increase/decrease offset on second cube from origin point
Z: set fov and rotation speed to something that looks neat
